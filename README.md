# MLViewsProject

To report what impact a video title, tags, genre, likes/dislikes and description have on the views of a video. (A thanks to Kaggle.com for the dataset)

Columns I have removed from the original file that I thought may not have an affect on views are:
- videoId
- comments_disabled
- ratings_disabled
- video_error_or_removed
- Maybe thumbnail, unless I can find a way to scan the img inside the links for more info
