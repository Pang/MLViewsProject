# MLViewsProject

To report what impact a video title, tags and category have on the views of a video when trending. (A thanks to Kaggle.com for the dataset)
Rows: 40949

### Test 1
For my first test, I have only used the video title as the feature to predict the views. This was with a test_size of 0.2 and a multinomial classifier.
I was let down to see a 0.0007326007326007326% accuracy when predicting but feel this may be improved with a regressional approach.

### Test 2
Used a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algo this time and got -0.058562924377011605% accuracy :(
